# 🌿 FirmSafe - Smart AI-Powered Plant Disease Detection & Weather Forecasting
FirmSafe is an intelligent AI/ML-based agricultural solution that empowers farmers and gardeners to identify plant diseases through image analysis and receive supplement suggestions tailored to the diagnosed issue. Additionally, it predicts weather conditions to help users take proactive decisions in crop management.

🚀 Features
✅ Plant Disease Detection using image recognition and machine learning

💊 Supplement Suggestion System based on identified diseases

🌤️ Weather Forecasting for better planning and preventive care

🧠 AI/ML Integration for accurate and evolving predictions

🧪 Built with Python, Machine Learning models, and Weather APIs

🖼️ How It Works
Upload an image of the plant or leaf showing symptoms.

The model analyzes the image using trained ML algorithms.

It detects the disease, if any, and suggests appropriate supplements.

Simultaneously, weather data is fetched and displayed to assist with field planning.


🧪 Model Training
The plant disease classifier is trained using a labeled dataset of leaf images across multiple crops. The model is capable of distinguishing among various common diseases using deep learning (CNN-based architectures).


📍 Use Cases
1. Farmers looking for quick identification of crop issues

2.Agri-tech startups for rapid deployment tools

3. Researchers building smart farming solutions

4. Educators and students learning ML in agriculture


📈 Future Enhancements
1. Add multilingual support for regional users

2. Integrate crop recommendation based on soil and weather

3. Build a mobile app version

4. Add voice assistant features for accessibility
